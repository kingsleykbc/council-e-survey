## SHANGRI-LA COUNCIL E-SURVEY

This is an online e-survey platform, where users send anonymous responses to surveys posted by the city council. It is a react PWA built with React and Next.js and firebase

This tools used for this application are:

- Next.js: Framework
- Firebase: Backend, database, and hosting
- TypeScript and tsx: Language
- Framer motion: Animation
- CSS: UI/Styling

The styles are entirely built from scratch in CSS alone, and framer motion is only used to animate some of the elements.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
